      "description": "Collaborative learning is more than just studying in groups — it is about building knowledge together. When students share ideas, challenge each other's thinking, and solve problems as a team, they gain deeper understanding and stronger communication skills. Teachers play a key role in guiding this process by creating activities that encourage teamwork, discussion, and reflection. For students, working collaboratively improves critical thinking, creativity, and confidence. For teachers, it provides a chance to see different perspectives and identify where students need more support. Together, collaborative learning makes education an active, engaging, and rewarding journey.",
